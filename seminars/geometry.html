<b>Homotopy fiber product of differentiable manifolds</b><br>
Dr. Hsuan-Yi Liao (Korea Institute for Advanced Study in Seoul, Republic of Korea) <br>

<dd> A fiber product of smooth manifolds might not be a manifold. Thus, we extend the category of smooth manifolds to a larger category in which one can consider homotopy fiber products of manifolds. In the talk, following a framework of abstract homotopy theory, I will present a differential geometric way (using vector bundles and sections) to resolve the singular spaces raised from fiber products or intersection of smooth manifolds. The talk is mainly based on a joint work with Kai Behrend and Ping Xu.<br>

Kyeongmin No (Seoul National University, Korea) <br>

<dd> Burban and Drozd (2017) classified all indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over degenerate cusps. For the degenerate cusp defined by $xyz$, its mirror is given by a pair of pants (Abouzaid, Auroux, Efimov, Katzarkov and Orlov).
We find explicit objects in the Fukaya category of a pair of pants, which correspond to every indecomposable Cohen-Macaulay modules in Burban and Drozd's list under the localized mirror functor. This is a joint work in progress with Cheol-Hyun Cho, Wonbo Jeong and Kyoungmo Kim.<br>

Sangjin Lee (IBS Center for Geometry and Physics in Pohang, Korea) <br>

    <dd> Many of my topologists, but not symplectic topologists, friends asked me a question: what topological information could be provided from Fukaya categories? In this talk, we will see an example answering the question.
        More precisely, I will introduce an algebraic tool that makes Ganatra-Pardon-Shende's result easier to be applied. With the tool, one could compute the wrapped Fukaya categories of cotangent bundles of Lens spaces, which are equivalent to each other, if two Lens spaces are of the same homotopy type.
This talk is based on a joint work in progress with Dogancan Karabas.<br>

Eunjeong Lee (IBS Center for Geometry and Physics in Pohang, Korea) <br>
    
    <dd> Bruhat interval polytopes form an interesting family of polytopes lie in the permutohedron, each of which is defined by the convex hull of points associated with permutations $z$ for $v \le z \le w$. A Bruhat interval polytope is the moment polytope of a subvariety of the flag variety, called a <i>Richardson variety</i>, and it is known that the Richardson variety is a smooth toric variety if and only if the Bruhat interval polytope is combinatorially equivalent to a cube. In this talk, we will consider an interesting family of smooth projective toric varieties, called toric varieties <i>of Catalan type</i>. As one may expect, there is a bijective correspondence between the set of toric varieties of Catalan type and that of polygon triangulation. Moreover, we will study the isomorphism classes of toric varieties of Catalan type and how they are related to smooth toric Richardson varieties. This talk is based on joint work with Mikiya Masuda and Seonjeong Park.<br>

Philsang Yoo (YMSC, Tsinghua University, China) <br>

<dd> S-duality is a non-trivial equivalence of two physical theories. The main aim of the talk is to explain how to mathematically understand S-duality in the simple context of topological string theory, or more precisely, a twisted version of type IIB supergravity theory. A large part of the talk will be devoted to providing a dictionary between string theory and mathematical objects. This talk is based on a joint work with Surya Raghavendran. <br>

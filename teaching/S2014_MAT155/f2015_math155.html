2014-05-25: Letter grades has been submitted. If you want to know how you did in your final exam, please email me by using your CUNY email account. Enjoy the summer!<br>
2014-05-11: <a href="S2014_MAT175/finalpractice.pdf">Here</a> is a practice test for your departmental final exam. Since the actual final exam, based on which your pass/fail status is determined, will be very similar to this practice test(and this practice test doesnâ€™t deviate much from the sample final exam as well), IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO MASTER ALL THESE PROBLEMS. I will go over this practice test in our last class meeting, Thursday May 15th, 9AM. In the meantime, please try this test on your own, and ask questions. I will give out the hardcopy on Tuesday May 13th.<br>

<h3><p>Exam Schedules</p></h3>
Exam I: <FONT COLOR="#C40062">October 8th (Thursday),</FONT> In-class.<br>
- Sections 6.3, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 7.1, 7.2, 7.5, 7.6, 8.1, 8.2 will be covered.<br>
- Total 10 questions. One question from each section.<br>
- Problems will be mostly taken from the exercises at the end of each of section.<br>
- If you go over examples we discussed in class and try yourself a couple of similar calculations using those sets of exercises, that will be an optimal preparation.<br>
- Here is a set of <a href="F2015_MATH155/review_for_exam1.pdf">Review Problems for Exam I</a>.<br>

<br><br>

Exam II: TBA <br>
Exam III (Final): TBA <br><br>

<!--


Midterm-II: <FONT COLOR="#C40062">May 1st(Thursday),</FONT> In-class.<br>
- Based on the course calendar, from Lesson 14 to Lesson 21 will be covered.<br>
- There will be 14 problems(100 points total). Outline of the exam and the type of problems will be very similar to the following practice test: <a href="S2014_MAT175/midterm2practicetest.pdf" title="Open Midterm I Practice Test">Practice Test PDF</a><br>
- Related problems in the sample final exams are as follows:<br>
Sample Final(The most relevant one): Chapter 3 --- #4, #5, #11. Chapter 4 ---  #8, #12, #13, #14, #18(a).  (This exam was distributed in hardcopy, and also available from below.)<br>
- No problem will be completely identical to sample final exams or homework problems. At least, numbers will be changed.<br>
- Part I consists of 8 problems(5 points each).<br>
- Part II consists of 6 problems(10 points each).<br>
Beware that this exam will be <em>difficult</em>, and <em>may take long time to finish</em>, just because the corresponding sample final exam problems are so. It is strongly discouraged if you are planning to come and take this exam without enough practice. Since problems are a little more involved, especially problems #12, #13, #14 in the sample final exam, I will ask 6 problems in Part II of the practice exam <em>identically</em> in the actual exam.<br>
Here are <a href="S2014_MAT175/midterm2.pdf"  title="Open Midterm II">Problems</a> and <a href="S2014_MAT175/midterm2sol.pdf"  title="Open Midterm II Solution">Solutions</a>. The average was 47.9 and the maximum score achieved by a student was 71.<br><br>

Final: <FONT COLOR="#C40062">May 22nd 8:30AM--10:30AM(Thursday),</FONT> at <FONT COLOR="#C40062">APEX 228</FONT>(the same room). We will follow the <a href="http://www.lehman.edu/registrar/documents/spring-2014-final-exam-schedule.pdf" title="Open Final Exam Schedule">registrar's schedule</a> for the final exam.<br>
The final exam will be the <em>uniform departmental final exam</em>: <a href="S2014_MAT175/mat175samplefialsp2014_2.pdf" title="Open MAT175 Sample Final Exam">The most relevant sample final exam</a>(An error in #10 and #15(2014-03-31) corrected). <a href="F2013_MAT175/mat175samplefinal.pdf" title="Open MAT175 Sample Final Exam">Sample Final I</a> and <a href="F2013_MAT175/mat175samplefinalsol.pdf" title="Open MAT175 Sample Final Exam Solution">its solution</a>. <a href="F2013_MAT175/mat175samplefinal2.pdf" title="Open MAT175 Sample Final Exam 2">Sample Final II</a>.

<!--
 <FONT COLOR="#C40062">October 3rd(Thursday),</FONT> In-class.<br>
- Based on the course calendar, from Lesson 1 to Lesson 10 will be covered, but all precalculus materials(Chapter 1/Trigonometry review) will be excluded.<br>
- There will be 17 problems(100 points total).<br>
- In sample final exams, only a small portion of problems fall into the coverage of this midterm exam. Related problems in the sample final exams are as follows:<br>
Sample Final 1: #8, #9, #16 (This exam was distributed in hardcopy, and also available from below)<br>
Sample Final 2: #7, #14<br>
Practice Problem Set: #6, #7, #8<br>
- No problem will be completely identical to sample final exams or homework problems. At least, numbers will be changed.<br>
- Part I consists of 10 problems(5 points each). Among the sample final type questions(problem numbers above), 8 questions will be asked, and the other 2 problems are simple calculations which are not precisely found from those sample exams, but won't be a surprise even if such a type shows up in the actual final exam.<br>
- Part II consists of 7 problems. First 4 problems(5 points each) are calculations which are not of sample final type, but are either very simple or something one needs to master at this point, to handle one of sample final type questions arises in the next chapter on differentiation. Remaining 3 problems ask proofs(10 points each), but <a href="F2013_MAT175/midterm1info.pdf" title="Open Midterm I Info">here</a> is information about what's going to be asked. All these three questions are conceptually very essential in grasping what you learned in this chapter about limits.<br>
Here are <a href="F2013_MAT175/midterm1.pdf"  title="Open Midterm I">Problems</a> and <a href="F2013_MAT175/midterm1sol.pdf"  title="Open Midterm I Solution">Solutions</a>. The average was 44.7 and the maximum score achieved by a student was 92. Regardless of one's exam score, everyone must completely master Part I problems in this exam, especially because those are problems presumably one cannot avoid if one wants to get passed from MAT175. If you think you didn't do very well in Part I, I suggest visiting the tutoring center(Gillet 222) and receive help from tutors(for free!). Those tutors should be very helpful, knowledgeable, patient and etc. So they won't disappoint you. If they did, please let me know.<br><br>
Midterm-II: <FONT COLOR="#C40062">November 7th(Thursday),</FONT> In-class.<br>
- Based on the course calendar, from Lesson 11 to Lesson 20 will be covered.<br>
- There will be 18 problems(100 points total).<br>
- No problem will be completely identical to sample final exams or homework problems. At least, numbers will be changed.<br>
- Note that 50% of both Sample Final Exams(1 and 2) fall into the coverage of this midterm exam. Related problems in the sample final exams are as follows:<br>
Sample Final 1:<br>
Definition of the derivative: #15<br>
Power rule, derivative of trigonometric and exponential functions: #1, #2, #3<br>
Velocity and acceleration: #12<br>
Product and quotient rules: #5<br>
The chain rule: #6<br>
Implicit differentiation: #4<br>
Related rates: #10<br>
Sample Final 2: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #10, #11, #13<br>
Practice Problem Set: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #9, #13, #14, #15, #16, #18<br>
- The best strategy would be focusing on the above list of problems in sample finals, and using textbook for more examples and practice problems.<br>
Here are <a href="F2013_MAT175/midterm2.pdf"  title="Open Midterm II">Problems</a> and <a href="F2013_MAT175/midterm2sol.pdf"  title="Open Midterm II Solution">Solutions</a>. The average was 38.6 and the maximum score achieved by a student was 75.<br><br>

Midterm-III: <FONT COLOR="#C40062">December 3rd(Tuesday),</FONT> In-class.<br>
- Based on the course calendar, from Lesson 21 to Lesson 27 will be covered.<br>
- There will be 12 problems(100 points total).<br>
In the coverage of this exam, there are only a few sample final problems, but note that a large portion of 10-point-worth problems are asked in this part. There are three typical types(Problem numbers are from Sample Final 1):<br>
Finding absolute maximum and minimum values: #13<br>
Finding all relative extrema: #14<br>
Finding inflection points and determination of concavity: #11<br>
Calculations of infinite limits: #7, Sample Final 2-#9<br>
Sample Final 2: #8, #9, #12, #15, #16<br>
Practice Problem Set: #10, #11, #12, #17<br>
- In this exam, all problems will be of these types.<br>
Beware that this exam will be <em>difficult</em>, and <em>may take long time to finish</em>, just because the corresponding sample final exam problems are so. It is strongly discouraged if you are planning to come and take this exam without enough practice. Since problems themselves are involved, please refer the following PDF file:  <a href="F2013_MAT175/midterm3prep.pdf"  title="Open MAT175 Midterm Exam III Practice Problems">Midterm Exam III Practice Problems</a>. All 8 problems in this PDF file will be asked <em>identically</em> in this exam.<br><br>

<b>Review Session for Final Exam</b><br>
The tutoring center(MCSLC) will offer a review session for students taking MAT175 as follows:<br>
Date and Time: May 17th(Saturday), 12PM--4PM<br>
Location: Gillet Room 333<br>
I think the review session will focus on helping students to get better scores in the uniform departmental final exam. Please plan to attend!<br>

<h3><p>About using old editions of course textbook</p></h3>
As it is explicitly stated in the departmental MAT175 syllabus, you can use 4th edition of the course textbook. If you are a 4th edition user, you can do one of the following for numberings of homework: (1) <a href="F2013_MAT175/mat175syllabus4e.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open MAT175 Syllabus based on 4th edition">Here</a> is a syllabus based on the 4th edition. You can use this syllabus to find which problems you should work out in your 4th edition. (2) The hardcopy version of MAT175 syllabus I distributed contains problem numbers in the 5th edition. You can ignore the fact that this is based on the 5th edition, and instead think of it as a syllabus for the 4th edition.<br><br>

To avoid any disadvantages to an old edition user, I will try not to make any part of exams identical to problems in any particular edition. At minimum, I will change numbers randomly.

2012-12-11: There will be a Calculus Review Session offered by the MCSLC on Saturday December 15th, from 12PM to 4PM at Gillet 333.<br>
2012-12-04: <FONT COLOR="red">Homework #12</FONT> is posted below. This will be the last homework in this course. For those parts indicated as optional, you do not need to hand-in. Now it is a good timing to start looking at sample final exam and the practice problems for final. Feel free to email me at any time if you need help or wish to discuss about your solutions. I think we will be able to have exercise sessions during next week. It would be very good if you try all in these two problem sets over the weekend and ask questions during exercise sessions about anything that was unclear in your own attempt.<br>
2012-11-28: One more <FONT COLOR="#C40062">practice problem set for the final exam</FONT> and <FONT COLOR="red">Homework #11</FONT> are posted below.<br>

2012-11-20: The <FONT COLOR="#C40062">optional midterm exam</FONT> will be given on <FONT COLOR="#C40062">Friday, November 30th 10:00AM--11:40AM at Gillet 319</FONT>. <FONT COLOR="#C40062"><b>Note different time and room.</b></FONT> Also check out <FONT COLOR="red">Homework #9, #10</FONT> below.<br>

This will be the last day of the class before the final exam. For another missing lesson, we will replace the last lesson scheduled for review by the optional midterm exam. The problems in this exam will be prepared to give you an opportunity to have a thorough review on materials in chapter 2 and 3 of the textbook, and thus it is a good idea to sign-up and take this exam. I will post the problems and solutions on this web page. Even if you cannot take this optional exam, you can have the same practice by looking at them.<br>
2012-11-06: I wish to know how many of you are planning to take the <FONT COLOR="#C40062">optional midterm exam</FONT> before scheduling it. This exam will cover the entire chapter 2 and chapter 3 we did in class. If this is your third midterm exam, then the lowest midterm score will be dropped. Please sign-up by email if you are planning to take, until November 14th 11:59PM. If you signed-up, please make sure you received a receipt from me. I will try to schedule the date, time and the location with those who signed-up.<br>

During the interval, keep studying by using the review sheet, and email me if you need help about any exercises or concepts.<br>

<h3><p>Quizzes</p></h3>
Precalculus Assessment Quiz: <a href="F2012_MAT175/quiz0.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open Precalculus Assessment Quiz">PDF</a> --- If you want your solution reviewed, or if you want to get ideas how to proceed those problems we did not go over together, you can hand-in your solution. It is a good idea to write down at which point you are not clear about the problem. We can repeat this several times until you are totally convinced. Also feel free to email me about your questions.<br><br>

<FONT COLOR="#7000DF"><b>Quiz #1</b></FONT> (Section 2.2, 2.3) --- The quiz will consist of four problems with five questions total, which I think all are simple. Duration will be approximately 30 to 40 minutes, but it will actually take shorter than this. Thorough understanding of materials in the textbook will be the best preparation, and try to make sure that you can do examples and homework problems by yourself, without any hesitation. Repeat the training several times by working out similar exercises. Also if you think about those exercises which were assigned during classes, it will be very helpful in strengthening and solidifying your understanding. Please do not hesitate to email me if you have any question during the interval. Good luck!
<br><br>

Here are <a href="F2012_MAT175/quiz1.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open Quiz1">Problems</a> and <a href="F2012_MAT175/quiz1sol.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open Quiz1 solution">Solutions</a>. The average was 12.19 and the maximum score achieved by a student was 40. Here is what I suggest: <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Do these problems again</FONT>, carefully and seamlessly, and <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">hand-in your new solution</FONT> no later than the first mid-term exam. Then I will change your score based on the new solution. I want you to fully master what was asked in this quiz. Try to make very clear in each step you are proceeding, by looking up the textbook and also the solution I posted. Discuss with your friends and ask me after class or by email. If you already received the full score for a problem, you don't need to do that again, but attach your original solution to the new one. To make sure, I will ask similar ideas in the first mid-term exam.
<br><br>

<FONT COLOR="#7000DF"><b>Quiz #2</b></FONT> (Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.3) --- Take-home quiz. Due: November 6th before class. <a href="F2012_MAT175/quiz2.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open Quiz2">Problems</a> and <a href="F2012_MAT175/quiz2sol.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open Quiz2 solution">Solutions</a>. Make-up policy for this quiz is the same as Quiz 1. If you hand-in an update of your solution, I will change your score based on new one. You do not need to do problems you received a full score, but staple your new solution over the previous version. The average score will not be calculated, since I do not know when I can collect solutions from everyone, but as of today November 6th, the maximum was 80.

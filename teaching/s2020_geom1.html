<h2><p>Exam Schedules</p></h2>
Midterm Exam: TBA <br> <!-- <FONT COLOR="#C40062">28 October (Monday),</FONT> In-class.<br>
- Coverage: Chapters 1, 2, and 3.<br>
- Total 8 questions. There will be one set of True/False questions (Please note that you get full credit if you are correct, no credit for no answer, and negative of the assigned score if your answer to this question is incorrect.), 3 questions which are identical or directly related to homework problems, and remaining 4 questions are from those discussed in class. This exam would gear toward giving advantages to those who were carefully following class discussions while keeping a good pace of doing homework. <br>
- We still meet on 29 October (Tuesday) as scheduled for a regular class meeting.<br>
Here are <a href="f2019_geom2/midterm.pdf"  title="Open Midterm Exam">Problems</a> and <a href="f2019_geom2/midtermsol.pdf"  title="Open Midterm Exam Solution">Solutions</a>. The average was 46.93 and the maximum score achieved by a student was 95.<br>
- If you think you did not get a score you deserve, you are welcome to dispute. Please do that no later than 18:00 of the day before your final exam day.<br>
<br>-->
Final Exam: TBA <!-- <FONT COLOR="#C40062">16 December (Monday),</FONT> In-class.<br>
- Coverage: Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (only those sections covered in class).<br>
- Total 8 questions. The style and focus of the exam will be similar to the midterm exam. Chapters 1, 2, and 3 will be only indirectly covered in this exam to the extent that the exam assumes everything we studied together in this course. Exam problems will be mostly from those materials we studied after the midterm exam.<br>
Here are <a href="f2019_geom2/final.pdf"  title="Open final Exam">Problems</a> and <a href="f2019_geom2/finalsol.pdf"  title="Open Final Exam Solution">Solutions</a>. The average was 58.57 and the maximum score achieved by a student was 90.<br>
- If you think you did not get a final grade you deserve, you are welcome to dispute. Please remember that the correction request has to be filed no later that 30 December 2019.<br>

<h2><p>Group activity</p></h2>

Nearing the end of the semester, you are expected to be able to prove the 48 Propositions of Euclid's Book I assigned as follows. During the group presentation session, each group will be asked to prove selected propositions. Each speaker may use notes or other necessary references and is expected to present the statement of the proposition, proof, relevant remarks such as existing flaws.<br><br>

Group 1: Book I, Propositions 1 to 12<br>
Group 2: Book I, Propositions 13 to 24<br>
Group 3: Book I, Propositions 25 to 36<br>
Group 4: Book I, Propositions 37 to 48<br>

You may consult available monograph like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Euclids-Elements-AU-Euclid/dp/1888009187/">Euclid's "Elements"</a> but you do not have to purchase this book. A reading copy will be available for you to borrow from your instructor.<br>-->


<br><br>

<h2><p>Updates and plan for Assignment-based Class due to a new Corona Virus (COVID-19) outbreak</p></h2>
Following the decision of the university center, the first day of class has been deferred to March 16th. Also following another decision of the university, we shall not meet during the period March 16th to 28th and make-up those 6-contact hours by an "Assignment-based Class." See the course syllabus for details. Please stay tuned for any further updates which will be posted on the course webpage.


<h2><p>Assignment-based Classes</p></h2>
Week 1:  Read the main textbook from Sections 1.1 to 1.5 and complete Homework #1 above by the due date. Lecture notes and reading materials are available on CBNU e-Campus (blackboard).
<br><br>
Week 2: TBA<br>

<b>Review Session for Final Exam</b><br>
The tutoring center(MCSLC) will offer a review session for students taking MAT175 as follows:<br>
Date and Time: May 17th(Saturday), 12PM--4PM<br>
Location: Gillet Room 333<br>
I think the review session will focus on helping students to get better scores in the uniform departmental final exam. Please plan to attend!<br>
Here is <a href="S2014_MAT175/MCSLC_review.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open Review Session Info">a document on review session</a>.<br>


<br><br>

<h3><p>About using old editions of course textbook</p></h3>
As it is explicitly stated in the departmental MAT175 syllabus, you can use 4th edition of the course textbook. If you are a 4th edition user, you can do one of the following for numberings of homework: (1) <a href="F2013_MAT175/mat175syllabus4e.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open MAT175 Syllabus based on 4th edition">Here</a> is a syllabus based on the 4th edition. You can use this syllabus to find which problems you should work out in your 4th edition. (2) The hardcopy version of MAT175 syllabus I distributed contains problem numbers in the 5th edition. You can ignore the fact that this is based on the 5th edition, and instead think of it as a syllabus for the 4th edition.<br><br>

To avoid any disadvantages to an old edition user, I will try not to make any part of exams identical to problems in any particular edition. At minimum, I will change numbers randomly.

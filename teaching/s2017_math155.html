2015-12-28: A <FONT COLOR="#C40062">solution to the Exam III</FONT> has been posted below.<br>
2015-12-18: The grading has been done, and I have assigned letter grades to each total score. If you want to know your final exam score as well as assigned letter grade, you can email me using your CUNY email address. After receiving your score, you can review how grading is done and dispute about the assigned letter grade if you wish. I will do my best to discuss with you in an impartial manner. I am planning on finishing all the above procedures by Dec. 24th.<br>
2015-12-10: Thank you for following well until the last lesson. I wish all the best for your finals. I can help you preparing for final for this course in the following ways: (1) If you want to consult your own solution with me, please take a photo or scan it and email it to me. Then I will comment on it. (2) If you need to see a written solution by me, email me with the problem number you are struggling with. I will write down a solution and email you back. (3) I will be around at Hunter or CUNY Graduate Center for work. You can email me to set up an appointment for in-person discussion.<br>
2015-12-10: Here is a solution to <a href="F2015_MATH155/exam3review_no2.pdf">Problem #2</a> in review problem set for final exam.

<b>Review Session for Final Exam</b><br>
The tutoring center(MCSLC) will offer a review session for students taking MAT175 as follows:<br>
Date and Time: May 17th(Saturday), 12PM--4PM<br>
Location: Gillet Room 333<br>
I think the review session will focus on helping students to get better scores in the uniform departmental final exam. Please plan to attend!<br>
Here is <a href="S2014_MAT175/MCSLC_review.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open Review Session Info">a document on review session</a>.<br>


<br><br>

<h3><p>About using old editions of course textbook</p></h3>
As it is explicitly stated in the departmental MAT175 syllabus, you can use 4th edition of the course textbook. If you are a 4th edition user, you can do one of the following for numberings of homework: (1) <a href="F2013_MAT175/mat175syllabus4e.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open MAT175 Syllabus based on 4th edition">Here</a> is a syllabus based on the 4th edition. You can use this syllabus to find which problems you should work out in your 4th edition. (2) The hardcopy version of MAT175 syllabus I distributed contains problem numbers in the 5th edition. You can ignore the fact that this is based on the 5th edition, and instead think of it as a syllabus for the 4th edition.<br><br>

To avoid any disadvantages to an old edition user, I will try not to make any part of exams identical to problems in any particular edition. At minimum, I will change numbers randomly.

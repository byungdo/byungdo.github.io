<h3><p>Exam Schedules</p></h3>
Midterm-I: <FONT COLOR="#C40062">February 26th(Tuesday),</FONT> In-class.<br>
Since there is no allocated lesson in the course calendar, We will not have a review session before the first midterm exam. However, the following information will be sufficient for preparation. <br>
<em><FONT COLOR="#804000">- All problems will be chosen identically from assigned homework.<br>
- Among all homework problems, it is likely to be chosen if a problem is (1) of a type asked in the provided sample final exam. (2) simple.<br>
- 15 questions will be asked, and there will be no partial credits.<br></FONT></em>
- Based on the course calendar, from Lesson 1 to Lesson 6 will be covered.<br>
- Related sample final exam problems are: #1[2.7], #2[3.6], #12[3.2]
<br>
Here are <a href="S2013_MAT104/midterm1.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open Midterm I">Problems</a> and <a href="S2013_MAT104/midterm1sol.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open Midterm I Solution">Solutions</a>. The answer to the #7 as in the form appeared in the exam should be x=-15. The average of enrolled students was 5.8/15(38.8%), the average of examinees was 6.2/15(41.3%), and the maximum score achieved by a student was 14/15(93.3%).<br><br>

Midterm-II: <FONT COLOR="#C40062">March 19th(Tuesday),</FONT> In-class.<br>
The format and style of the exam will be the same to the midterm I. In particular, <FONT COLOR="#804000"><em>first three items</em></FONT> will remain exactly as before, and about the fourth and the fifth item:<br>
- Based on the course calendar, from Lesson 8 to Lesson 13 will be covered.<br>
- Related sample final exam problems are: #3[5.3], #4[5.4], #5[5.4], #6[6.1], #8[7.2], #9[7.2], #10[7.3]<br>
Here are <a href="S2013_MAT104/midterm2.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open Midterm II">Problems</a> and <a href="S2013_MAT104/midterm2sol.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open Midterm II Solution">Solutions</a>. The average of enrolled students was 5.0/15(33.3%), the average of examinees was 6.1/15(40.5%), and the maximum score achieved by a student was 13/15(86.7%).<br><br>

Midterm-III: <FONT COLOR="#C40062">April 23th(Tuesday),</FONT> In-class.<br>
To assist you to be prepared for the departmental final exam, I will make this exam as the following:<br>
- It will be a cumulative exam. i.e. the exam will cover from Lesson 1 to Lesson 20 based on the course calendar.<br>
- All problems will be of one of the type in the sample final exam.<br>
- Problems will not be identical from homework, since it is obvious that the uniform final exam problems will not be identical from the homework I assigned.<br>
- 15 questions will be asked, and there will be no partial credits.<br>
Be aware that if you cannot receive a score greater than or equal to 9/15, you are very likely to fail in the departmental final exam unless you do not put a special attention in studying this subject.<br>
Here are <a href="S2013_MAT104/midterm3.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open Midterm III">Problems</a> and <a href="S2013_MAT104/midterm3sol.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open Midterm III Solution">Solutions</a>. The average of enrolled students was 3.5/15(23.1%), the average of examinees was 5.2/15(34.7%), and the maximum score achieved by a student was 9/15(60.0%).<br><br>

Final:  <FONT COLOR="#C40062">May 21st 4:00PM--6:00PM(Tuesday),</FONT> at <FONT COLOR="#C40062">Gillet 203</FONT>(the same room). We will follow the <a href="http://www.lehman.edu/registrar/documents/spring-2013-final-exam-schedule.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open Final Exam Schedule">registrar's schedule</a> for the final exam.<br>
The final exam will be the <em>uniform departmental final exam</em>: <a href="S2013_MAT104/mat104samplefinal.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open MAT104 Sample Final Exam">A sample final exam</a>, and a <a href="S2013_MAT104/mat104samplefinalsol.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open MAT104 Sample Final Exam Solution">solution</a>.

<h3><p>Announcements</p></h3>
2014-05-25: Letter grades has been submitted. If you want to know how you did in your final exam, please email me by using your CUNY email account. Enjoy the summer!<br>
2014-05-11: <a href="S2014_MAT175/finalpractice.pdf">Here</a> is a practice test for your departmental final exam. Since the actual final exam, based on which your pass/fail status is determined in your MAT175 class, will be very similar to this practice test(and this practice test doesn’t deviate much from the sample final exam as well), IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO MASTER ALL THESE PROBLEMS.<br>
2014-05-11: Please check out a schedule for <b><FONT COLOR="#800040">Review Session</FONT></b> offered by the tutoring center, MCSLC. It's in "Tutoring Information" section in the bottom of this page.<br>
2014-04-25: There will be a problem session for preparing MAT175 final exam on May 1st class meeting. Here are problems we will go over together. Please try these problems(integration problems as well if you can) over the weekend and ask questions. <a href="F2013_MAT175/mat175samplefinal.pdf"  title="Open MAT175 Sample Final Exam">MAT175 Sample Final Exam</a>(old version), <a href="F2013_MAT175/mat175samplefinalsol.pdf"  title="Open MAT175 Sample Final Exam Solution">solutions</a>, and <a href="S2014_MAT155/mat155integrationpractice.pdf"  title="Open MAT175 Practice Problem Set on Integration">a problem set on integration</a>.

2014-03-09: Reflecting the change in MAT155 syllabus in this semester, we will have only one midterm exam following the syllabus. The section syllabus now reflects the change.<br>
2014-02-15: CUNY follows Monday schedule on <FONT COLOR="#008000">Thursday, February 20th</FONT>, and hence we don't meet on that day.<br>
2014-02-15: If you missed this week's lab(February 13th), please finish the MWS by yourself or by receiving help from a tutor in MCSLC, and email it to me. The material is very easy, and it won't take too long to finish.<br>

<h3><p>Exam Schedules</p></h3>
Midterm: <FONT COLOR="#C40062">March 20th(Thursday),</FONT> In-class.<br>
The exam will cover from Lesson 1 to Lesson 6, and it will be elementary in the sense that as long as you understand problems and explorations in MWS files we have been going over, you will be able to solve all problems in the exam. You will be <b>allowed</b> to open previous lab files during the exam. So if you wish, you can bring your MWS files in your USB or download it from your email account or etc. If you don’t have your files available, and I am the only one who has your MWS files, please email me back so that I can send it to you.<br>
Final: <FONT COLOR="#C40062">May 22nd 11:00AM--12:40PM(Thursday),</FONT> at <FONT COLOR="#C40062">Gillet 223</FONT>(the same room).<br>We will follow the <a href="http://www.lehman.edu/registrar/documents/spring-2014-final-exam-schedule.pdf" title="Open Final Exam Schedule">registrar's schedule</a> for the final exam.<br>

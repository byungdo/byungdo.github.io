<!--  2012-12-21: Letter grades are submitted.<br>
2012-12-20: Grading of the final exam has been finished. Letter grades will be submitted soon. If you want to know your numeric scores, please email me by using your CUNY email account.<br>
2012-12-11: There will be a Calculus Review Session offered by the MCSLC on Saturday December 15th, from 12PM to 4PM at Gillet 333.<br>
2012-12-04: <FONT COLOR="red">Homework #12</FONT> is posted below. This will be the last homework in this course. For those parts indicated as optional, you do not need to hand-in. Now it is a good timing to start looking at sample final exam and the practice problems for final. Feel free to email me at any time if you need help or wish to discuss about your solutions. I think we will be able to have exercise sessions during next week. It would be very good if you try all in these two problem sets over the weekend and ask questions during exercise sessions about anything that was unclear in your own attempt.<br>
2012-11-28: One more <FONT COLOR="#C40062">practice problem set for the final exam</FONT> and <FONT COLOR="red">Homework #11</FONT> are posted below.<br>
2012-11-23: A <FONT COLOR="#C40062">review sheet for the optional midterm exam</FONT> is posted below. Even if you think your scores are fine, please consider taking this exam. It will be a good chance to have a through review for the final exam. Good luck to everyone who will take this exam.<br>
2012-11-20: The <FONT COLOR="#C40062">optional midterm exam</FONT> will be given on <FONT COLOR="#C40062">Friday, November 30th 10:00AM--11:40AM at Gillet 319</FONT>. <FONT COLOR="#C40062"><b>Note different time and room.</b></FONT> Also check out <FONT COLOR="red">Homework #9, #10</FONT> below.<br>
2012-11-13: A <FONT COLOR="#C40062">solution of the midterm exam II</FONT> is posted below.

2012-11-10: To make-up lost class time due to hurricane Sandy, we will meet on CUNY reading day, <FONT COLOR="#008040">Thursday, December 13th 2012,</FONT> at the same time and location. This will be the last day of the class before the final exam. For another missing lesson, we will replace the last lesson scheduled for review by the optional midterm exam. The problems in this exam will be prepared to give you an opportunity to have a thorough review on materials in chapter 2 and 3 of the textbook, and thus it is a good idea to sign-up and take this exam. I will post the problems and solutions on this web page. Even if you cannot take this optional exam, you can have the same practice by looking at them.<br>
2012-11-06: I wish to know how many of you are planning to take the <FONT COLOR="#C40062">optional midterm exam</FONT> before scheduling it. This exam will cover the entire chapter 2 and chapter 3 we did in class. If this is your third midterm exam, then the lowest midterm score will be dropped. Please sign-up by email if you are planning to take, until November 14th 11:59PM. If you signed-up, please make sure you received a receipt from me.

<h3><p>Precalculus Assessment Test</p></h3>
Here are <a href="F2013_MAT175/mat172samplefinal.pdf"  title="Open Precalculus Assessment Test">problems</a> and <a href="F2013_MAT175/mat172samplefinalsol.pdf"  title="Open Precalculus Assessment Quiz Solutions">solutions</a> to the assessment test given in Lesson 1.<br><br>

<h3><p>Exam Schedules</p></h3>
Midterm-I: <FONT COLOR="#C40062">October 3rd(Thursday),</FONT> In-class.<br>
- Based on the course calendar, from Lesson 1 to Lesson 10 will be covered, but all precalculus materials(Chapter 1/Trigonometry review) will be excluded.<br>
- There will be 17 problems(100 points total).<br>
- In sample final exams, only a small portion of problems fall into the coverage of this midterm exam. Related problems in the sample final exams are as follows:<br>
Sample Final 1: #8, #9, #16 (This exam was distributed in hardcopy, and also available from below)<br>
Sample Final 2: #7, #14<br>
Practice Problem Set: #6, #7, #8<br>
- No problem will be completely identical to sample final exams or homework problems. At least, numbers will be changed.<br>
- Part I consists of 10 problems(5 points each). Among the sample final type questions(problem numbers above), 8 questions will be asked, and the other 2 problems are simple calculations which are not precisely found from those sample exams, but won't be a surprise even if such a type shows up in the actual final exam.<br>
- Part II consists of 7 problems. First 4 problems(5 points each) are calculations which are not of sample final type, but are either very simple or something one needs to master at this point, to handle one of sample final type questions arises in the next chapter on differentiation. Remaining 3 problems ask proofs(10 points each), but <a href="F2013_MAT175/midterm1info.pdf" title="Open Midterm I Info">here</a> is information about what's going to be asked. All these three questions are conceptually very essential in grasping what you learned in this chapter about limits.<br>
Here are <a href="F2013_MAT175/midterm1.pdf"  title="Open Midterm I">Problems</a> and <a href="F2013_MAT175/midterm1sol.pdf"  title="Open Midterm I Solution">Solutions</a>. The average was 44.7 and the maximum score achieved by a student was 92. Regardless of one's exam score, everyone must completely master Part I problems in this exam, especially because those are problems presumably one cannot avoid if one wants to get passed from MAT175. If you think you didn't do very well in Part I, I suggest visiting the tutoring center(Gillet 222) and receive help from tutors(for free!). Those tutors should be very helpful, knowledgeable, patient and etc. So they won't disappoint you. If they did, please let me know.<br><br>
Midterm-II: <FONT COLOR="#C40062">November 7th(Thursday),</FONT> In-class.<br>
- Based on the course calendar, from Lesson 11 to Lesson 20 will be covered.<br>
- There will be 18 problems(100 points total).<br>
- No problem will be completely identical to sample final exams or homework problems. At least, numbers will be changed.<br>
- Note that 50% of both Sample Final Exams(1 and 2) fall into the coverage of this midterm exam. Related problems in the sample final exams are as follows:<br>
Sample Final 1:<br>
Definition of the derivative: #15<br>
Power rule, derivative of trigonometric and exponential functions: #1, #2, #3<br>
Velocity and acceleration: #12<br>
Product and quotient rules: #5<br>
The chain rule: #6<br>
Implicit differentiation: #4<br>
Related rates: #10<br>
Sample Final 2: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #10, #11, #13<br>
Practice Problem Set: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #9, #13, #14, #15, #16, #18<br>
- The best strategy would be focusing on the above list of problems in sample finals, and using textbook for more examples and practice problems.<br>
Here are <a href="F2013_MAT175/midterm2.pdf"  title="Open Midterm II">Problems</a> and <a href="F2013_MAT175/midterm2sol.pdf"  title="Open Midterm II Solution">Solutions</a>. The average was 38.6 and the maximum score achieved by a student was 75.<br><br>

Midterm-III: <FONT COLOR="#C40062">December 3rd(Tuesday),</FONT> In-class.<br>
- Based on the course calendar, from Lesson 21 to Lesson 27 will be covered.<br>
- There will be 12 problems(100 points total).<br>
In the coverage of this exam, there are only a few sample final problems, but note that a large portion of 10-point-worth problems are asked in this part. There are three typical types(Problem numbers are from Sample Final 1):<br>
Finding absolute maximum and minimum values: #13<br>
Finding all relative extrema: #14<br>
Finding inflection points and determination of concavity: #11<br>
Calculations of infinite limits: #7, Sample Final 2-#9<br>
Sample Final 2: #8, #9, #12, #15, #16<br>
Practice Problem Set: #10, #11, #12, #17<br>
- In this exam, all problems will be of these types.<br>
Beware that this exam will be <em>difficult</em>, and <em>may take long time to finish</em>, just because the corresponding sample final exam problems are so. It is strongly discouraged if you are planning to come and take this exam without enough practice. Since problems themselves are involved, please refer the following PDF file:  <a href="F2013_MAT175/midterm3prep.pdf"  title="Open MAT175 Midterm Exam III Practice Problems">Midterm Exam III Practice Problems</a>. All 8 problems in this PDF file will be asked <em>identically</em> in this exam.<br><br>
Here are <a href="F2013_MAT175/midterm3.pdf"  title="Open Midterm III">Problems</a> and <a href="F2013_MAT175/midterm3sol.pdf"  title="Open Midterm III Solution">Solutions</a>. The average was 76.3 and the maximum score achieved by a student was 97.<br><br>


Final: <FONT COLOR="#C40062">December 19th 11:00AM--1:00PM(Thursday),</FONT> at <FONT COLOR="#C40062">Gillet 305</FONT>(the same room). We will follow the <a href="http://www.lehman.edu/registrar/documents/fall-2013-final-exam-schedule.pdf" title="Open Final Exam Schedule">registrar's schedule</a> for the final exam.<br>
The final exam will be the <em>uniform departmental final exam</em>: <a href="F2013_MAT175/mat175samplefinal.pdf" title="Open MAT175 Sample Final Exam">A sample final exam</a> and <a href="F2013_MAT175/mat175samplefinalsol.pdf" title="Open MAT175 Sample Final Exam Solution">a solution</a>. <a href="F2013_MAT175/mat175samplefinal2.pdf" title="Open MAT175 Sample Final Exam 2">Sample final exam 2</a>. To pass this course, one should receive score<em> 55% or up</em> from this uniform final exam.

<h3><p>Quizzes</p></h3>
Precalculus Assessment Quiz: <a href="F2012_MAT175/quiz0.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open Precalculus Assessment Quiz">PDF</a> --- If you want your solution reviewed, or if you want to get ideas how to proceed those problems we did not go over together, you can hand-in your solution. It is a good idea to write down at which point you are not clear about the problem. We can repeat this several times until you are totally convinced. Also feel free to email me about your questions.<br><br>

<FONT COLOR="#7000DF"><b>Quiz #1</b></FONT> (Section 2.2, 2.3) --- The quiz will consist of four problems with five questions total, which I think all are simple. Duration will be approximately 30 to 40 minutes, but it will actually take shorter than this. Thorough understanding of materials in the textbook will be the best preparation, and try to make sure that you can do examples and homework problems by yourself, without any hesitation. Repeat the training several times by working out similar exercises. Also if you think about those exercises which were assigned during classes, it will be very helpful in strengthening and solidifying your understanding. Please do not hesitate to email me if you have any question during the interval. Good luck!
<br><br>

Here are <a href="F2012_MAT175/quiz1.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open Quiz1">Problems</a> and <a href="F2012_MAT175/quiz1sol.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open Quiz1 solution">Solutions</a>. The average was 12.19 and the maximum score achieved by a student was 40. Here is what I suggest: <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Do these problems again</FONT>, carefully and seamlessly, and <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">hand-in your new solution</FONT> no later than the first mid-term exam. Then I will change your score based on the new solution. I want you to fully master what was asked in this quiz. Try to make very clear in each step you are proceeding, by looking up the textbook and also the solution I posted. Discuss with your friends and ask me after class or by email. If you already received the full score for a problem, you don't need to do that again, but attach your original solution to the new one. To make sure, I will ask similar ideas in the first mid-term exam.

<FONT COLOR="#7000DF"><b>Quiz #2</b></FONT> (Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.3) --- Take-home quiz. Due: November 6th before class. <a href="F2012_MAT175/quiz2.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open Quiz2">Problems</a> and <a href="F2012_MAT175/quiz2sol.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open Quiz2 solution">Solutions</a>. Make-up policy for this quiz is the same as Quiz 1. If you hand-in an update of your solution, I will change your score based on new one. You do not need to do problems you received a full score, but staple your new solution over the previous version. The average score will not be calculated, since I do not know when I can collect solutions from everyone, but as of today November 6th, the maximum was 80.

<h3><p>About using old editions of course textbook</p></h3>
As it is explicitly stated in the departmental MAT175 syllabus I distributed as a hardcopy(as of now 2013-09-05 3:00AM, the link in the top of this page provides old syllabus based on 4th edition), you can use 4th edition of the course textbook. If you are a 4th edition user, you can do one of the following for numberings of homework: (1) <a href="F2013_MAT175/mat175syllabus4e.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open MAT175 Syllabus based on 4th edition">Here</a> is a syllabus based on the 4th edition. You can use this syllabus to find which problems you should work out in your 4th edition. (2) The hardcopy version of MAT175 syllabus I distributed contains problem numbers in the 5th edition. You can ignore the fact that this is based on the 5th edition, and instead think of it as a syllabus for the 4th edition.<br><br>

To avoid any disadvantages to an old edition user, I will try not to make any part of exams identical to problems in any particular edition. At minimum, I will change numbers randomly.

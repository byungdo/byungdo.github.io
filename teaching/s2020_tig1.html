<b>Review Session for Final Exam</b><br>
The tutoring center(MCSLC) will offer a review session for students taking MAT175 as follows:<br>
Date and Time: May 17th(Saturday), 12PM--4PM<br>
Location: Gillet Room 333<br>
I think the review session will focus on helping students to get better scores in the uniform departmental final exam. Please plan to attend!<br>
Here is <a href="S2014_MAT175/MCSLC_review.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open Review Session Info">a document on review session</a>.<br>


<br><br>

<h3><p>About using old editions of course textbook</p></h3>
As it is explicitly stated in the departmental MAT175 syllabus, you can use 4th edition of the course textbook. If you are a 4th edition user, you can do one of the following for numberings of homework: (1) <a href="F2013_MAT175/mat175syllabus4e.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open MAT175 Syllabus based on 4th edition">Here</a> is a syllabus based on the 4th edition. You can use this syllabus to find which problems you should work out in your 4th edition. (2) The hardcopy version of MAT175 syllabus I distributed contains problem numbers in the 5th edition. You can ignore the fact that this is based on the 5th edition, and instead think of it as a syllabus for the 4th edition.<br><br>

To avoid any disadvantages to an old edition user, I will try not to make any part of exams identical to problems in any particular edition. At minimum, I will change numbers randomly.

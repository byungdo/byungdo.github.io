<h2><p>List of advanced topics in geometry</p></h2>
Depending on Corona-19 pandemic situation, we may meet in class and individually study some advanced topics from geometry.<br><br>
<!--
Nearing the end of the semester (Weeks 13, 14, and 15), you are expected to be able to to one of the following:
<ul>
  <li> A statement and a proof of Stokes' theorem using differential forms</li>
  <li> Maxwell's equation and abelian gauge theory</li>
  <li> A proof of the theorem of Morse</li>
  <li> Lie groups, Lie algebras, and adjoint representations</li>
  <li> Weekly mock teaching practice. Three topics from middle and high school geometry of your choice. For each topic, you will give a 20-minute long mock lecture in each week. Your lecture will be video-recorded and openly discussed in class. After that the recorded video file will be deleted of course.</li>
 </ul>-->




<!--
The midterm will be either a take-home exam or an oral exam. (Your choice.) Please read <a href="S2016_MATH250/midtermpolicies.pdf" title="Midterm Exam Policies">midterm exam policies</a>. The take-home exam will be distributed and posted here on the date of the lesson that finishes Chapter 3.<br>

The midterm exam will cover Chapter 1 to Chapter 3. (Section 3.5. optional this time.)<br>

<b>Review Session for Final Exam</b><br>
The tutoring center(MCSLC) will offer a review session for students taking MAT175 as follows:<br>
Date and Time: May 17th(Saturday), 12PM--4PM<br>
Location: Gillet Room 333<br>
I think the review session will focus on helping students to get better scores in the uniform departmental final exam. Please plan to attend!<br>
Here is <a href="S2014_MAT175/MCSLC_review.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open Review Session Info">a document on review session</a>.<br>


<br><br>

<h3><p>About using old editions of course textbook</p></h3>
As it is explicitly stated in the departmental MAT175 syllabus, you can use 4th edition of the course textbook. If you are a 4th edition user, you can do one of the following for numberings of homework: (1) <a href="F2013_MAT175/mat175syllabus4e.pdf" target="_blank" title="Open MAT175 Syllabus based on 4th edition">Here</a> is a syllabus based on the 4th edition. You can use this syllabus to find which problems you should work out in your 4th edition. (2) The hardcopy version of MAT175 syllabus I distributed contains problem numbers in the 5th edition. You can ignore the fact that this is based on the 5th edition, and instead think of it as a syllabus for the 4th edition.<br><br>

To avoid any disadvantages to an old edition user, I will try not to make any part of exams identical to problems in any particular edition. At minimum, I will change numbers randomly.

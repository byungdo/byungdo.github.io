<!--  2012-12-21: Letter grades are submitted.<br>
2012-12-20: Grading of the final exam has been finished. Letter grades will be submitted soon. If you want to know your numeric scores, please email me by using your CUNY email account.<br>
2012-12-11: There will be a Calculus Review Session offered by the MCSLC on Saturday December 15th, from 12PM to 4PM at Gillet 333.<br>
2012-12-04: <FONT COLOR="red">Homework #12</FONT> is posted below. This will be the last homework in this course. For those parts indicated as optional, you do not need to hand-in. Now it is a good timing to start looking at sample final exam and the practice problems for final. Feel free to email me at any time if you need help or wish to discuss about your solutions. I think we will be able to have exercise sessions during next week. It would be very good if you try all in these two problem sets over the weekend and ask questions during exercise sessions about anything that was unclear in your own attempt.<br>
2012-11-28: One more <FONT COLOR="#C40062">practice problem set for the final exam</FONT> and <FONT COLOR="red">Homework #11</FONT> are posted below.<br>
2012-11-23: A <FONT COLOR="#C40062">review sheet for the optional midterm exam</FONT> is posted below. Even if you think your scores are fine, please consider taking this exam. It will be a good chance to have a through review for the final exam. Good luck to everyone who will take this exam.<br>
2012-11-20: The <FONT COLOR="#C40062">optional midterm exam</FONT> will be given on <FONT COLOR="#C40062">Friday, November 30th 10:00AM--11:40AM at Gillet 319</FONT>. <FONT COLOR="#C40062"><b>Note different time and room.</b></FONT> Also check out <FONT COLOR="red">Homework #9, #10</FONT> below.<br>

<h3><p>College Algebra Assessment Test</p></h3>

<h3><p>Exam Schedules</p></h3>
Midterm-I: <FONT COLOR="#C40062">October 1st(Tuesday),</FONT> In-class.<br>
- Based on the course calendar, from Lesson 1 to Lesson 7 will be covered.<br>
- There will be 18 problems(80 points total).<br>
- No problem will be completely identical to sample final exams or homework problems. At least, numbers will be changed, but those formats of problems will be maintained. So picking problems from sample final exams and homework will be the best strategy for practice.<br>
- In <a href="F2013_MAT172/mat172samplefinal1.pdf" title="Open MAT172 Sample Final Exam 1">Sample Final Exam I</a>, related problems are: #1, #3, #4, #6, #8, #11, #15. For each of these problem types, at least 2 problems will be asked. So total 14 problems(60 points) will be allocated for these sample-final-types.<br>
- Remaining 4 problems(20 points) will be of types one can easily solve if one has been working on homework well. In particular, if one understands (1) completing the square for solving a given quadratic equation, (2) translation of the graph of a parabola, (3) composition of two functions, and (4) equation of a circle in a plane, one may feel some familiarity to those problems.<br>
Here are <a href="F2013_MAT172/midterm1.pdf"  title="Open Midterm I">Problems</a> and <a href="F2013_MAT172/midterm1sol.pdf"  title="Open Midterm I Solution">Solutions</a>. The average was 39.80(49.8%) and the maximum score achieved by a student was 78(97.5%). Regardless of one's exam score, everyone must completely master Part I problems in this exam, especially because those are problems presumably one cannot avoid if one wants to get passed from MAT172. If you think you didn't do very well in Part I, I suggest visiting the tutoring center(Gillet 222) and receive help from tutors(for free!). Those tutors should be very helpful, knowledgeable, patient and etc. So they won't disappoint you. If they did, please let me know.<br><br>
Midterm-II: <FONT COLOR="#C40062">November 5th(Tuesday),</FONT> In-class.<br>
- Based on the course calendar, from Lesson 9 to Lesson 17 will be covered. Note that Section 3.5 is included to the coverage of this exam.<br>
- There will be 12 problems(72 points total).<br>
- No problem will be completely identical to sample final exams or homework problems. At least, numbers will be changed, but those formats of problems will be maintained. So picking problems from sample final exams and homework will be the best strategy for practice.<br>
- In particular, put emphasis on sample final exam problems, and review homework for more problems to practice. All problems of this exam will be of sample final type, and there will be no question asking something else other than these types.<br>
- In <a href="F2013_MAT172/mat172samplefinal1.pdf" title="Open MAT172 Sample Final Exam 1">Sample Final Exam I</a>, related problems are: #5, #9, #10, #16, #17.<br>
- For Sample Final I-#16 and #17, exam problems will possibly be completely identical to practice problems in the department webpage. Here are links:<br> <a href="http://lehman.edu/academics/mathematics-computer-science/max-min.php" title="Open MAT172 Max-Min Problems Page">Maximum/Minimum problems as applications of quadratic functions</a><br><a href="http://lehman.edu/academics/mathematics-computer-science/growth.php" title="Open MAT172 Growth/Decay Problems Page">Growth/decay model problems as applications of exponential and logarithmic functions</a><br>

<br><br>

Midterm-III: <FONT COLOR="#C40062">December 5th(Thursday),</FONT> In-class.<br>
- The coverage of this exam is the same as the coverage of the final exam. All materials we have been and will be discussing before this exam will be included to this coverage.<br>
- There will be 17 problems(80 points total).<br>
- This exam will be almost identical(mostly change in numbers) to Sample Final Exam I.<br>
- This exam is a real practice for the final exam. If you don't receive a passing score from this exam, you are very likely to receive non-passing score from the actual final exam. So please take this exam seriously.<br>
- Even if you feel difficulties in preparing it, or even if you don't get a satisfactory score from this exam, you should never give up. Please come and talk to me or email me to consult how you can improve your score.<br>

<h3><p>About using old editions of course textbook</p></h3>
Professor Fera wrote to MAT172 instructors that: "Due to high price of the newest edition of the course text, the department asks that you please allow your students to use EITHER the 7th, OR the 8th, OR the 9th edition of the indicated book. The content is virtually the same, but there has been substantial changes made to the exercise sections. Please take this account when/if you create assignments from the textbook."<br><br>

When it comes to assigning homework, it is unavoidable to use numberings in the problem set at the end of each section, and accordingly I will assign homework based on the 9th edition, which I received from the department. If you are a user of a previous edition, it is <em>okay</em> to use previous edition and work on problems having the same numbering. Then there may be discrepancies between problems I wanted you to solve and you will actually work on while using an old edition. For that matter, I think it can be easily resolved by comparing pages in my copy of the text and the old edition you have, by simply looking over my copy after each class meeting.<br><br>

To avoid any disadvantages to an old edition user, I will try not to make any part of exams identical to problems in any particular edition. At minimum, I will change numbers randomly.

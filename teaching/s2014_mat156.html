<h3><p>Exam Schedules</p></h3>
Midterm: <FONT COLOR="#C40062">March 4th(Tuesday),</FONT> In-class.<br>
The exam will cover from Lesson 1 to Lesson 5, and it will be elementary in the sense that as long as you understand how to solve those bold-face problems in the MW files we have been going over, you will be able to solve all problems in the exam. You will be <b>allowed</b> to open previous lab files during the exam. So if you wish, you can bring your MW files in your USB or download it from your email account or etc. If you don’t have your files available, and I am the only one who has your MW files, please email me back so that I can send it to you.<br>
Final: <FONT COLOR="#C40062">May 20th 11:00AM--12:40PM(Tuesday),</FONT> at <FONT COLOR="#C40062">Gillet 223</FONT>(the same room).<br>We will follow the <a href="http://www.lehman.edu/registrar/documents/spring-2014-final-exam-schedule.pdf" title="Open Final Exam Schedule">registrar's schedule</a> for the final exam.<br>
